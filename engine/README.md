# Modifications made to the game wrapper
The game wrapper was modified so it understands the `stderrEnabled` bot property. If this is set to `true`, the game wrapper will send the bot's stderr to it's own stderr. For this to be possible, the game wrapper was first decompiled and put into a Maven project to make it easier to make changes. Please note that except for a few lines this was entirely written by @[riddlesio](https://github.com/riddlesio).
